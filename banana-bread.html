<h2>Sweet breakfast bread made from the withered corpses of bananas you bought last week and forgot about.</h2>
<p>During my time in Milan, my dearest neighbor Esmerelda, would bake the most delicious banana bread. She would toil for days and days, milling the flour, handpicking eggs, testing bananas for their ripeness at the local corner shops, and churning butter made from the milk of her dairy cows. Her efforts produced the most marvelous of homemade breakfast breads.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this is not that recipe. Go to your local shop. Grab some quick and easy ingredients and then wait for your bananas to turn black. Like, seriously, don't even attempt to make banana bread with yellow bananas. As bananas over-ripen, the sugars in the fruit get more and more concentrated. The perfect time to make banana bread is once the bananas are nice and mushy. The skin should peel away easily, leaving you with a slightly messy banana shaped goop on your cutting board.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li class="item">2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li class="item">1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li class="item">1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li class="item">1/2 cup butter</li>
    <li class="item">3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
    <li class="item">2 eggs, beaten</li>
    <li class="item">2 1/3 cups mashed overripe bananas</li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, cream butter and brown sugar.</li>
    <li>Stir eggs and mashed bananas into your creamed butter and sugar.</li>
    <li>Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; stir just to moisten. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.</li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack.</li>
</ol>
