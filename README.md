# odin-recipes
This is the first project associated with The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. It's purpose is to create a barebones recipe page using HTML. Future projects include modifying the recipes page with CSS.

This will be my first attempt at demonstrating my knowledge of HTML based solely on TOP's Foundations curriculum and will be used as practice.
