    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>During my time in Milan, my dearest neighbor Esmerelda, would bake the most delicious banana bread. She would toil for days and days, milling the flour, handpicking eggs, testing bananas for their ripeness at the local corner shops, and churning butter made from the milk of her dairy cows. Her efforts produced the most marvelous of homemade breakfast breads.</p>
    <p>Needless to say, that is not this recipe. Go to your local shop. Grab some quick and easy ingredients and then wait for your banans to turn black. Like, seriously, don't even attempt to make banana bread with yellow bananas. As banans over-ripen, the sugars in the fruit get more and more concentrated. The perfect time to make banana bread is once the bananas are nice and mushy. The skin should peel away easily, leaving you with a slightly messy banana shaped goop on your cutting board.</p>
